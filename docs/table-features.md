# Table Tools Overview

Click the **Insert Table** button in the editor toolbar to launch the table builder dialog, choose the size and default styling you want, and drop a polished table directly into your document. As soon as the cursor rests inside any table, the contextual **Table Tools** button appears with the full suite of structure, border, and highlighting controls.

## Insert New Tables

- **Launch the Builder** – Use *Insert Table* to open a pop-up for configuring rows (1–20) and columns (1–10).
- **Live Preview & Presets** – Type exact dimensions or pick from quick-size chips and preview the result in real time.
- **Border Defaults** – Toggle borders, adjust width (0–12 px), choose a style, and select a custom hex color. These defaults are applied to the inserted table and remembered for future tables.
- **Header Ready** – The first row is generated as a header when borders are enabled, keeping tables readable by default.
- **One-Click Insert** – Confirm to place the table at the caret and begin editing immediately.

## Structure & Layout

- **Row / Column Management** – Insert or remove rows and columns around the current selection.
- **Cell Operations** – Merge adjacent cells or split merged cells with a single click.
- **Table Removal** – Delete the active table entirely when it is no longer needed.
- **Resizing Guidance** – Drag built-in column handles or the custom row bars inside the editor for precise sizing.

## Border Styling

- **Border Width** – Adjust thickness from 0–12 px with the slider.
- **Border Styles** – Toggle instantly between solid, dashed, dotted, double, groove, ridge, or no border.
- **Color Controls** – Choose from curated swatches or enter any custom hex value.
- **Quick Reset** – Remove all borders to present a clean, gridless layout.
- **Default Sync** – When no table is selected, updates apply to the default styling for future tables.

## Cell Backgrounds

- **Row / Column Highlights** – Apply consistent background colors across the current row or column selection.
- **Custom Palettes** – Use preset swatches or define custom colors with the picker and hex input.
- **Instant Clear** – Revert highlighted cells back to the base theme with one action.
- **Selection Aware** – Commands respect the active selection, so you can target specific cells, rows, or columns.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Place the cursor inside a table to reveal the **Table Tools** button and enable structural actions.
- Preview changes live; most controls apply immediately to the active selection.
- Without an active table, color and border tweaks update the default styling applied by the insert dialog and future tables.
